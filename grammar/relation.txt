Original list:
~~ margin is relative to width
~~ it's allowed but you may run into impl limits
property has no effect
~~ lots of funky rules at CSS2r1 10.3
~~ percent is relative to the width of the containing block
~~ padding values can not be negative
element is block-level
element is inline-level
element is positioned
element is absolutely-positioned
position is relative to position in normal flow
position is relative to containing block
percent is relative to height of the containing Block's height
percent is relative to width of the containing Block's height
top/right/bottom/left do not apply
element is formatting-context
right does not apply
bottom does not apply
~~element can not ovrlap floated element's margin box.
element is stacking-context
element is floated
~~establishes a new containing block for normal flow children and absolutely (but not fixed) positioned descendants.
float does not apply

display computes to block
z-index does not apply

Rearranged:

~~ it's allowed but you may run into impl limits	// that's a warning, not a "relation"

~~ lots of funky rules at CSS2r1 10.3	// ok we'll pick those up there then.

~~ padding values can not be negative
//that's an error / warning,
// ..or we do "padding computes to 0"?

~~element can not overlap floated element's margin box.
// has to be a warning for now

~~establishes a new containing block for normal flow children and absolutely (but not fixed) positioned descendants.
// I think this one is simply: element is containing-block
// the caveats are encoded in other parts of the spec (or are they? that's not clear)

Box Model:
    ref: CSS2r1 8
    Margins:
        ref: 8.3
        property:
            name:
                - margin
                - margin-left
                - margin-right
                - margin-top
                - margin-bottom
            value:
                - length
                - percentage
                - auto
            initial: 0
            inherited: no
                # we could add percentage: instead of matching
                # same for applies to

        percentages:
            match: margin/margin-top/margin-bottom specified in percentages
            relation: margin is relative to width of containing-block
                # width of what?
        negative values:
            match: margin/margin-top/margin-bottom/margin-left/margin-right is negative
            warning: Negative margins are allowed but you may run into implementation limits
        no effect:
            match: margin/margin-top/margin-bottom is specified
                and element is non-replaced
                and element is inline
            relation: margin-top/margin-bottom do not apply

        #auto:
            #match: margin* is auto
                # it will be auto, but then the actual used value will get calculated
                # so this is an example of implied/specified versus used
                # Note if this kind of thing only happens with auto values, we can infer "specified" when we see auto.
            # relation: ~~ lots of funky rules at CSS2r1 10.3
        Collapsing:
            ref: 8.3.1
            # this is going to be much harder because it involves multiple elements
            # skip it for now?
            # ..it may be possible and worthwhile to make a match that rules out collapsing

    Padding:
        ref: 8.4
        property:
            name:
                - padding
                - padding-left
                - padding-right
                - padding-top
                - padding-bottom
            value:
                - length
                - percentage
            initial: 0
            inherited: no

        percentages:
            match: padding-top/padding-bottom specified in percent
            relation: percent is relative to width of containing-block
                # this is useful even for lateral padding
        negative values:
            match: padding/padding-top/padding-bottom/padding-left/padding-right is negative #this should be specified values
            error: Padding values can not be negative
                # here this is an error condition we should treat as such
                # note chrome does give that error as "value is invalid"
                # note that computed values are 0px

    Borders:
        ref: 8.5
            # most of what goes on here is about how the different properties cna specify their values.
    Box model for inline elements and bidirectional content:
        ref: 8.6
            # some stuff about rtl direction and how it relates to left/right in props above.

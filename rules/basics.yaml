Basic concepts:
    Element:
        concept:
            name: element
                #doesn't apply to anything since it's kind of a root concept
    Replaced elements:
        # the definitions of replaced and non-replaced live in HTML spec:
        # https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#replaced-elements
        concept:
            name: replaced
            applies-to: element
    Non-Replaced elements:
        concept:
            name: non-replaced
            applies-to: element
            # could we not just rely on using "not replaced" in match?
            # Would also need to support setting relation as such:
            # relation: element is not replaced
            # implies that replaced is boolean, which won't be true of others?
            # In current setup we could erroneously have an
            # ..element that is bot replaced and non-replaced ?!?

    Root Element:
        concept:
            name: root
            applies-to: element
            # can't find the definition of root element in CSS specs.
            # But it's just what it seems I suppose?

    Normal Flow:
        concept:
            name: normal-flow
            # definition? applies-to?
